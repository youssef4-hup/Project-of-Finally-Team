Our project focuses on evaluating the healthcare sector in Egypt from the
perspective of patients and everyday citizens who frequently use medical services.
Since any developing country aiming to grow must strengthen its key sectors—
healthcare, education, and food security—we chose to analyze the current
challenges within the Egyptian healthcare system. Our goal is to understand
citizens’ satisfaction, identify common issues, and highlight areas that need
improvement based on real public feedback.
